        <h5 class="white-text">About Me</h5>
        <p class="white-text">My love for computers ignited when I was a 10 year old and got my first PC. I started programming at 14 when I was in 9th grade. The first big program I wrote was a social-networking website called <i>Netwuk</i> which was used by me and my classmates. I learned most of the stuff from the Internet by watching Youtube tutorials and some reading. I'm fluent in Java, C#, PHP and JavaScript & have worked on many Web, Android and Windows projects. Right now I'm a self-motivated and hardworking fresher seeking an opportunity to work in a challenging environment to prove and improve my skills and utilize my knowledge & intelligence in the growth of the organization.</p>
